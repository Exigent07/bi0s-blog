## Year 2023 

In the dynamic domain of cybersecurity, where every keystroke carries the weight of strategy and victory, Team bi0s has transcended the conventional definition of a club. <br>CTF, DFC, C2C – these are not just events; they're the arenas where our members have carved out a legacy of excellence.

We, a collective of college students from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/amritapuri/), harbour a profound passion for cybersecurity and hold an unwavering commitment to safeguarding tomorrow's Cyber Space. With a rich legacy spanning over a decade, we proudly lead the nation in CTF (Capture The Flag) rankings, holding the esteemed position of **No. 1** nationally and 46th worldwide according to [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/stats/).

With this context in mind, let's delve into the highlights of our endeavours in the past year.

## <u> CTFs</u>

### **DFC 2023**

[Digital Forensics Challenge (DFC 2023)](https://dfchallenge.org), conducted by the Korea Institute of Information Security and Cryptology (KIISC), was a competition where around 1200 participants, including researchers and working professionals in the field, engaged in a five-month long endeavour of solving real-world DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) challenges. 

Our team members *Nithin Chenthur, Sabhya Raj, Yadhu Krishna & Johith Lal* worked day and night during these 5 months, and the fruit of their work resulted in team bi0s emerging as the **No. 1** International team in the competition, and 6th worldwide. We received a cash prize of **₩3,000,000** and an invitation to participate in the prestigious DFRF 2023 Workshop conducted in Seoul, South Korea.

DFRF Workshop is a workshop conducted by KIISC concurrent with DFC. This year, it was held at Militopia Hotel, Seongnam, Seoul, South Korea, where our team members took part in the event and also got a chance to present the work they did throughout the competition and receive the prize for DFC 2023.

During the workshop, they got the chance to interact with a lot of field professionals, researchers and enthusiasts specialising in Digital Forensics and Incident Response.
