## Challenge description

![Description](description.png)

You can download the file from here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rIo-oQ8xyyWGLO6pzsEYPeHxQ7DTa-e7/view).

## Initial analysis

We are provided with a Windows memory dump. I'll be using **Volatility** to analyze, extract relevant artefacts.

### Finding the profile

We shall use the `imageinfo` plugin to find the profile of the memory dump

`$ volatility -f windows.vmem imageinfo`

So let us use the profile as `Win7SP1x64`.

## Answering 1st question

Question 1: `When did Adam last use the Windows calculator?`

So to find out when the calculator was last run, let us first try `pslist`, because if `calc.exe` was running in the system, then we can easily get the time stamp directly from the output generated by the `pslist` plugin.

`$ volatility -f windows.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist`

Well, we do not find any trace of calc.exe being executed. However, we do have a different source to obtain all the evidence we need. That is the `Windows Registry`.

The windows registry is a very very rich source of information. It has so many details that a forensic examiner needs to extract its information.

The details of processes like `run count`, `Last run time`, `execution path` etc... can be found in the Windows registry. To list out the registry hives, we can use the `hivelist` plugin.

`$ volatility -f windows.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 hivelist`

The important hive for this challenge is the `NTUSER.DAT`. So let me dump the hive and proceed to analyze its contents.

`$ volatility -f windows.vmem --profile=Win7SP1x64 dumpregistry -o 0xfffff8a00256d010 -D . `

I will be using **Eric Zimmerman's** `Registry Explorer` to load and analyze the registry.

**PATH**:`Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count`

As highlighted, the last run time of `calc.exe` is `2020-07-21 18:21:35`. Converting that to the format mentioned in the description would result in `21-07-2020_18:21:35`

## Answering 2nd question

In the same registry, we can also find the number of time Google Chrome was executed on the system.

![chrome](chrome.png)

As highlighted, the number is `19`.

## Flag

Let us concatenate the two answers as mentioned.

**FLAG**: `inctf{21-07-2020_18:21:35_19}`
